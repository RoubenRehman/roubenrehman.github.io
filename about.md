## WhoAmI?
Hi,

I'm Rouben. I'm an student in electrical and computer engineering who enjoys coding and tinkering around with hardware of all sorts.
I love trying out new things and learn new stuff, so, on this blog I write about exactly that. You can find me on GitHub [here](https://github.com/RoubenRehman "My GitHub")
