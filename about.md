## WhoAmI?
Hi,

I'm Rouben. I'm an engineer in electrical engineering and computer science who enjoys coding and tinkering around with hardware of all sorts.
I love trying out new things and always have to learn new things. On this blog I write about my adventures developing stuff and learning from it while doing. You can find me on GitHub [here](https://github.com/RoubenRehman "My GitHub")
