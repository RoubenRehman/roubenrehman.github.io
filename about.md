## WhoAmI?
I'm a student in electrical and computer engineering based in Europe. I'm super interested in Machine Learning and like to play around with code and all sorts of hardware. On this website, I'll try to write about my student life, my projects or just random thoughts in general. You can find me on GitHub [here](https://github.com/RoubenRehman "My GitHub")
