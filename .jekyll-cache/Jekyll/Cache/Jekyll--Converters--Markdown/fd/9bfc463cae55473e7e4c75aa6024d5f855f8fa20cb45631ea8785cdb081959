<p>Iâ€™m a student in electrical and computer engineering based in Europe. Iâ€™m super interested in Machine Learning and like to play around with code and all sorts of hardware. On this website, Iâ€™ll try to write about my student life, my projects or just random thoughts in general. You can find me on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/RoubenRehman" title="My GitHub">here</a></p>
